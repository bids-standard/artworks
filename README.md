## An animated BIDS logo using sozi

This repository contains an animated version of the BIDS logo.
The animation was done with [Sozi](https://sozi.baierouge.fr/).

`src/BIDS_logo_black.svg` contains a layered version of the original BIDS logo,
and the associated `src/*sozi*` files are the animation and its configuration.

The root level `bids-animated.webm` contains the animation rendered to `.webm`.

In addition, a freely licensed (CC-0) soundtrack from freesound.org in 
`src/soundtrack.wav` and the [kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/de/)
configuration in `project.kdenlive` were used to create the animation 
`bids-animated.mp4`.
